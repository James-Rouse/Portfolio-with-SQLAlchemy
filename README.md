# Portfolio-with-SQLAlchemy
 Treehouse Python Techdegree Unit 5 Project:

 "Create a web application using HTML, CSS, and Flask, a popular framework for Python web development. The web application, a portfolio, displays information about your work which is stored in a database."

 On this project, I learned how to use Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy as a backend for those HTML and CSS in web applications, as well as learning some basics of HTML and CSS usage themselves.

 To run the project locally, execute app.py, and then enter http://127.0.0.1:8000/ into your chosen brower.
